### How to export data to Excel “XLSX” in React.js

In the dynamic landscape of web development, React.js stands out as a powerful library for building robust user interfaces. One common requirement in many web applications is the ability to export data to Excel format. In this guide, we’ll explore how to achieve this seamlessly using SheetJS and File-Saver libraries in conjunction with React.js

### Why SheetJS and File-Saver?
SheetJS is a highly capable JavaScript library for parsing, manipulating, and writing data in various spreadsheet formats, including Excel. On the other hand, File-Saver simplifies the process of saving files generated by JavaScript in the browser. Together, these libraries provide a robust solution for exporting data to Excel format directly from a React.js application.
